\section*{S5 output}

By default, the output is A4 (with 12 pt font). 
To generate S5:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Uncomment \texttt{\textbackslash{}Spapertrue} flag in 
    \texttt{parameters.tex}.
  \item Compile \texttt{lic-thesis.tex}
  \item Compile \texttt{lic-thesis-S5.tex}
\end{enumerate}

The output \texttt{lic-thesis-S5.pdf} will be in the S5 format.

By enabling \texttt{\textbackslash{}Spapertrue} flag, 
the margins of the master are prepared to be scaled to S5. 
Namely, the master pdf (coming out from \texttt{lic-thesis.tex}) 
is scaled by \texttt{lic-thesis-S5.tex} so the original 
12 pt font will be scaled down to 11 pt in the resulting S5 output.

\paragraph*{Caution:} If you want to continue working with the
A4 output, do not forget to comment \texttt{\textbackslash{}Spapertrue} 
flag in \texttt{parameters.tex}.

\section*{Included PDFs}

You can include PDFs of the included papers by enabling
\texttt{\textbackslash{}IncludePDFstrue} flag in \texttt{parameters.tex}.
By default, the inclusion is disabled (as it slows done the compilation).

The page numbers of the included PDF will be overwritten by
the page numbers of the thesis.
The included papers will be then marked by twofold page numbers. 
For instance,
the folio \texttt{Paper\,II\,\textendash \,5\,(81)} marks a page
from Paper II having the internal (article) page number 5 and the
overall (thesis) page number 81.
To modify the position of the page numbers, see the arguments 
\texttt{\#5} and \texttt{\#6} in \texttt{\textbackslash{}paperSection}.
To debug the positions, you can temporarily enable the flags
\texttt{\textbackslash{}ShowLayouttrue} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}ShowGridtrue} in 
\texttt{parameters.tex}.
The macro \texttt{\textbackslash{}overlayPaperFolio} is responsible 
for emitting the thumb marks and page numbers on each page of the PDF. 
It can be found in \texttt{preamble.tex}.
